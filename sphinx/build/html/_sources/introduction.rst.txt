Matching a patient with a home health agency requires four interacting agents: the patient, the hospital, the home health agency, and the insurance. However, these agencies independently update their systems without communicating updates with one another which often leads to conflicting information. Consequently, potentially automated processes are completed manually and the process is prolonged. Under the stress of time and inefficient communication streams, discharge planners will sometimes coerce patients into matching with a convenient agency without personalization or transparency. Hospitals are under pressure by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to minimize this from happening, sometimes firing their discharge planners to avoid serious fines and penalties from the CMS. With all of this taken into consideration, Haoma is an integrated, home health referral management system built on the three fundamental pillars: efficiency, transparency, and personalization. The system will primarily be a recommendation dashboard for discharge planners to quickly and seamlessly generate home health agency recommendations personalized to the patient, with clear and relevant comparison metrics. However, it will also act as a platform where all parties are integrated, having access to the same platform and database to eliminate prior discrepancies. Most of all, it's a platform enabling patients to get personalized recommendations, faster care, and true transparency.
