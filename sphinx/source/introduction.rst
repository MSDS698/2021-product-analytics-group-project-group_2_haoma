Introduction
=====================================
   
Our solution is an integrated home health referral system aimed to mitigate existing inefficient communication streams, enable a streamlined discharge process, and optimize the time for a patient to get care, as well as the quality.

The system will primarily be a recommendation dashboard for discharge planners to quickly and seamlessly generate home health agency recommendations personalized to the patient, with clear and relevant comparison metrics. The use of real-time readmissions data ensures that the system continues to improve, optimizing for quality patient care.

It will also act as a platform where all parties are integrated, having access to the same platform and database to eliminate prior discrepancies. Most of all, itâ€™s a platform enabling patients to get personalized recommendations, faster care, and true transparency.
